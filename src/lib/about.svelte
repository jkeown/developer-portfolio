  <p>
  Discovering my passion for code a little later in life, I soon found myself sacrificing many things, (including sleep), to start this new adventure.  I slowly transitioned
  from pharmacy technician to freelance web developer utilizing primarily Jamstack technologies.
  Recently, I've been part of a team responsible for over 400 websites, resulting in my bug hunting and CSS skills having greatly improved, while also learning jQuery.</p><br /><p>I strive for clean code that is easy to read and maintain.  I've been described as pleasant to work with. I'm looking forward to joining a team that promotes growth and takes pride in delivering quality work. When not using my free time to code, you can find me surfing (waves not the internet). üèÑ</p>
